\begin{abstract}
Operating system kernels employs virtual memory subsystem which employs memory management units on each CPU to virtualize the addresses of memory regions:a logical (virtual) address which is translated to a physical address in memory by the MMU based on
kernel-controlled page tables -- a hardware-defined sparse tree-map structure -- stored in memory, which itself is accessed by the kernel through virtual addresses.
With this core mechanism, operating system kernels generalizes its memory-resource service to different contexts, mainly through the manipulating and aliasing 
same physical memory to multiple virtual addresses through the tree structure: subtrees or data pages may be shared across processes (e.g., the kernel mapping),
accessing an unmapped address produces a fault which the OS can use to kill the process or take corrective action (like add a mapping), and resume the interrupted code which constitutes the kernel's capability to restrict which memory is accessible to different processes, hide memory limits from user programs, ensure process isolation, implement paging and copy-on-write behaviors for performance
and resource controls.

So, verifying a full-featured version of the essential virtual memory manager systems is a crucial step towards achieving the progress towards handling fully verified real kernels written using these designs. 
Regarding this effort, in this paper, we introduce a modal abstraction to describe
the truth of assertions in the virtual resources corresponding to virtual address spaces: [r]P indicating that P holds in the
virtual address space rooted at r, which implicitly treats the memory state as a modal frame and the choice of
page table root as a world in Kripke-style semantics. Moreover, we define virtual points-to assertions defined in terms of physical points-to assertions
and hardware-specific address translation assertions, and paged points-to assertions. Finally, we experiment our abstractions in specifying and proving demand paging of a fresh page of zeros and context
switches between address spaces. All definitions and theorems mentioned in this paper including the operational model of a RISC-like fragment of x86-64, a simple language run on this operational model, and a logic as an instantiation of the Iris framework are mechanized inside Coq.
