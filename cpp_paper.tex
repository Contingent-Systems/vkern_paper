\begin{abstract}
Operating system kernels employ virtual memory subsystems, which use a CPU's memory management units (MMUs) to virtualize the addresses of memory regions:
a logical (virtual) address is translated to a physical address in memory by the MMU based on
kernel-controlled page tables -- a hardware-defined sparse tree-map structure -- stored in memory, which itself is 
accessed by the kernel through virtual addresses.
Operating systems manipulate these virtualized memory mappings to isolate untrusted processes,
 restrict which memory is accessible to different processes, 
hide memory limits from user programs, 
ensure process isolation, implement demand-paging and copy-on-write behaviors for performance
and resource controls.
At the same time, misuse of MMU hardware can lead to kernel crashes.

Virtual memory management (VMM) code is a critical piece of general-purpose OS kernels, but verification of this functionality
is challenging due to the complexity of the hardware interface (the page tables are updated via writes to those
memory locations, using addresses which are themselves virtualized).
Prior work on verification of VMM code has either only handled a single address space, trusted significant
pieces of assembly code, or resorted to direct reasoning over machine semantics rather than
exposing a clean logical interface.

In this paper, we introduce a modal abstraction to describe
the truth of assertions relative to a specific virtual address space: [r]P indicating that P holds in the
virtual address space rooted at r. Such modal assertions 
allow different address spaces to refer to each other, enabling complete verification of instruction sequences
manipulating multiple address spaces. Using them effectively requires working with other assertions,
such as points-to assertions in our separation logic, as relative to a given address space.
We therefore define virtual points-to relations, which mimic hardware address translation,
relative to a page table root.
We demonstrate our approach with challenging fragments of VMM code showing that our approach
handles examples beyond what prior work can address, including reasoning about
a sequence of instructions as it changes address spaces.
All definitions and theorems mentioned in this paper including the operational model of a RISC-like fragment of x86-64, 
a simple language run on this operational model, and a logic as an instantiation of the Iris framework are mechanized 
inside Coq.

\section{Conclusions}
This paper advances the state of the art in formal verification of programs subject to address translation
on hardware using virtual memory. We proposed to treat assertions about virtual
memory locations explicitly as assertions in a modal logic, where the notion of context
is the choice of current address space based on the page table root installed on the CPU.
We improved the modularity of our virtual address translation to allow page table modifications that
preserve mappings without collecting all affected virtual points-to assertions.
To make specifications of code involving other address spaces cleaner, we borrowed the idea of
modalities which explicitly name the conditions under which they are true from hybrid logics.
We implemented these ideas in a derived separation logic within Iris, and proved soundness of
the rules for essential memory- and address-space-change-related x86-64 instructions 
sound against a hardware model of 64-bit 4-level address translation.
Finally, we used our rules to verify the correctness of key VMM instruction sequences,
including giving the first assembly-level proof of correctness in a program logic for a change
of address space, against a specification which clearly identifies which assertions hold in which address space.
$\textsf{va}_0 \mapsto_{v} \textsf{v}_0 $ $\textsf{va}_1 \mapsto_{v} \textsf{v}_1 $ $\textsf{va}_2 \mapsto_{v} \textsf{v}_2 $ $\textsf{va}_i \mapsto_{v} \textsf{v}_{i}$
% In the future we plan to 
% extend our work in multiple directions, such as generalizing our assertions and proof rules
% to support large-page functionality common to virtual memory subsystems (superpages, hugepages),
