Operating system kernels employ virtual memory subsystems, which use a CPU's memory management units (MMUs) to virtualize the addresses of memory regions:
a logical (virtual) address is translated to a physical address in memory by the MMU based on
kernel-controlled page tables -- a hardware-defined sparse tree-map structure -- stored in memory, which itself is 
accessed by the kernel through virtual addresses.
Operating systems manipulate these virtualized memory mappings to isolate untrusted processes,
 restrict which memory is accessible to different processes, 
hide memory limits from user programs, 
ensure process isolation, implement demand-paging and copy-on-write behaviors for performance
and resource controls.
At the same time, misuse of MMU hardware can lead to kernel crashes.
\fi

Virtual memory management (VMM) code is a critical piece of general-purpose OS kernels, but verification of this functionality
is challenging due to the complexity of the hardware interface (the page tables are updated via writes to those
memory locations, using addresses which are themselves virtualized).
Prior work on verification of VMM code has either only handled a single address space, trusted significant
pieces of assembly code, or resorted to direct reasoning over machine semantics rather than
exposing a clean logical interface.

In this paper, we introduce a modal abstraction to describe
the truth of assertions relative to a specific virtual address space: [r]P indicating that P holds in the
virtual address space rooted at r. Such modal assertions 
allow different address spaces to refer to each other, enabling complete verification of instruction sequences
manipulating multiple address spaces. Using them effectively requires working with other assertions,
% such as points-to assertions in our separation logic,  relative to a given address space.
such as points-to assertions about memory contents --- which implicitly depend on the address space
they are used in. 
We therefore define virtual points-to assertions to definitionally mimic hardware address translation,
relative to a page table root.
We demonstrate our approach with challenging fragments of VMM code showing that our approach
handles examples beyond what prior work can address, including reasoning about
a sequence of instructions as it changes address spaces.

\section{Conclusions}
This paper advances the state of the art in formal verification of programs manipulating virtual memory mappings.
We treat assertions about virtual memory locations explicitly as assertions in a modal logic, where the notion of context
is a particular address space, named by the page table root.
We improved the modularity of our reasoning about virtual address translation and virtual points-to assertions
to permit page table modifications that
preserve mappings without collecting all affected virtual points-to assertions.
To specify of code involving other address spaces, we adapt 
hybrid logic's notion of \add{modalities} explicitly naming alternative conditions.
We implemented these ideas in a derived separation logic within \iris, and proved soundness of
the rules for essential memory- and address-space-change-related x86-64 instructions 
against a hardware model of 64-bit 4-level address translation.
Finally, we used our rules to verify the correctness of key VMM instruction sequences,
including the first assembly-level proof of correctness for a change
of address space expressing which assertions hold in which address space, 
the first physical-to-virtual translation proof,
\add{and the first verification of a software page table walk, all of which
are beyond reach of prior work}.

% In the future we plan to 
% extend our work in multiple directions, such as generalizing our assertions and proof rules
% to support large-page functionality common to virtual memory subsystems (superpages, hugepages),
% implementing 

% This is required for OOPSLA 2025
% \section*{Data Availability Statement}
% This work is backed by a substantial \rocq development, including
% (1) formalization of a subset of supervisor-mode x86-64 semantics;
% (2) specification and soundness proofs for the rules discussed in Section \ref{sec:logic}
% as well as additional rules covering arithmetic and bitwise operations,
% and fixed-offset variants of the memory access rules from Figure \ref{fig:wpdamd};
% and (3) proofs of the examples of Section \ref{sec:experiment}.

% The main limitation is \replace{the use of several axioms in the development, which are are currently
% in the process of removing. A}{that, a}s noted in Section \ref{sec:soundness}, control transfer instruction
% specifications are trusted (though again, entirely standard for assembly-level program logics~\cite{ni2007contexts,Ni2006codeptrs},
% aside from using our virtual points-to assertions in place of points-to assertions that assume flat memory).
% We also do not explicitly model instruction
% encoding and decoding, which is instead handled by an axiomatization of the relationship between
% byte sequences and instruction sequences, used in the definition of virtual code points-to
% assertions (i.e., assertions stating that a certain virtual address stores bytes
% encoding a valid instruction sequence with a given precondition, used for branches, call, and return instruction
% specifications). 
% \del{There are also a small number of axioms for a few bit-twiddling equivalences which are proving difficult to discharge
% with our XCAP-derived model of machine words.}

% % There are two main limitations.
% % The first is that our formalization does not explicitly model instruction
% % encoding and decoding, which is instead handled by an axiomatization of the relationship between
% % byte sequences and instruction sequences, used in the definition of virtual code points-to
% % assertions (i.e., assertions stating that a certain virtual address stores bytes
% % encoding a valid instruction sequence with a given precondition, used for branches, call, and return instruction
% % specifications). 
% % The second, as noted in Section \ref{sec:soundness}, is that control transfer
% % specifications are trusted (though again, entirely standard for assembly-level program logics~\cite{ni2007contexts,Ni2006codeptrs},
% % aside from using our virtual points-to assertions in place of points-to assertions that assume flat memory).
% \replace{We intend to submit this to artifact evaluation.
% We have attached a zip as supplementary material to the submission, though it does not
% currently include
% a guide for artifact evaluators.}{
%   Unfortunately we missed the line in the Major Revision notification that stated 
%   that we could submit an artifact this cycle. The notification also pointed to the call for papers
%   which still explicity states that Major Revisions were not allowed to submit artifacts.
%   If we are able to submit to a subsequent artifact evaluation cycle we will.
%   In either case, we will upload our artifact to Zenodo to obtain a DOI and archival storage,
%   and will cite it from the final version.
