\begin{abstract}
Operating system kernels employ virtual memory subsystems, which use a CPU's memory management units (MMUs) to virtualize the addresses of memory regions:
a logical (virtual) address is translated to a physical address in memory by the MMU based on
kernel-controlled page tables -- a hardware-defined sparse tree-map structure -- stored in memory, which itself is 
accessed by the kernel through virtual addresses.
Operating systems manipulate these virtualized memory mappings to isolate untrusted processes,
 restrict which memory is accessible to different processes, 
hide memory limits from user programs, 
ensure process isolation, implement demand-paging and copy-on-write behaviors for performance
and resource controls.
At the same time, misuse of MMU hardware can lead to kernel crashes.

Virtual memory management (VMM) code is a critical piece of general-purpose OS kernels, but verification of this functionality
is challenging due to the complexity of the hardware interface (the page tables are updated via writes to those
memory locations, using addresses which are themselves virtualized).
Prior work on verification of VMM code has either only handled a single address space, trusted significant
pieces of assembly code, or resorted to direct reasoning over machine semantics rather than
exposing a clean logical interface.

In this paper, we introduce a modal abstraction to describe
the truth of assertions relative to a specific virtual address space: [r]P indicating that P holds in the
virtual address space rooted at r. Such modal assertions 
allow different address spaces to refer to each other, enabling complete verification of instruction sequences
manipulating multiple address spaces. Using them effectively requires working with other assertions,
such as points-to assertions in our separation logic, as relative to a given address space.
We therefore define virtual points-to relations, which mimic hardware address translation,
relative to a page table root.
We demonstrate our approach with challenging fragments of VMM code showing that our approach
handles examples beyond what prior work can address, including reasoning about
a sequence of instructions as it changes address spaces.
All definitions and theorems mentioned in this paper including the operational model of a RISC-like fragment of x86-64, 
a simple language run on this operational model, and a logic as an instantiation of the Iris framework are mechanized 
inside Coq.

\section{Conclusions}
This paper advances the state of the art in formal verification of programs subject to address translation
on hardware using virtual memory. We proposed to treat assertions about virtual
memory locations explicitly as assertions in a modal logic, where the notion of context
is the choice of current address space based on the page table root installed on the CPU.
We improved the modularity of our virtual address translation to allow page table modifications that
preserve mappings without collecting all affected virtual points-to assertions.
To make specifications of code involving other address spaces cleaner, we borrowed the idea of
modalities which explicitly name the conditions under which they are true from hybrid logics.
We implemented these ideas in a derived separation logic within Iris, and proved soundness of
the rules for essential memory- and address-space-change-related x86-64 instructions 
sound against a hardware model of 64-bit 4-level address translation.
Finally, we used our rules to verify the correctness of key VMM instruction sequences,
including giving the first assembly-level proof of correctness for a change
of address space expressing which assertions hold in which address space, and the first physical-to-virtual translation proof.

\section{Translation Lookaside Buffers}
\label{apdx:tlb}
This section explains the challenges of formal reasoning about TLBs in more detail, including why
prior verified OS work trusts the flushing operations (and we believe this is reasonable), and why
full support for TLB reasoning is a significant, challenging problem on its own, requiring further
development before being integrated with general virtual memory reasoning.

As noted earlier,
TLB flushes are required only when addresses are removed from a virtual address space, or when changing
virtual address spaces. Because this occurs in few places in the kernel (in some, only 3 locations), full verified
kernels including \textsc{seL4}~\cite{Klein2009seL4,seL4TOCS} and \textsc{CertiKOS}~\cite{gu15,gu2016certikos}
trust TLB management. Neither of the aforementioned systems has a hardware model including a TLB, so neither is able
to verify TLB management in any form --- they \emph{must} trust its operation.

The only place the code itself becomes particularly challenging is in multiprocessor kernels, where
not only must the running CPU flush its TLB, but it must sent an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) to all
other cores to ensure they also flush the relevant ranges of their own TLBs.
Currently no formal hardware model exists with sufficient detail to reason about IPIs in full detail.
Multicore extensions of \textsc{seL4}~\cite{von2013clustered} and \textsc{CertiKOS}~\cite{gu2016certikos} also trust this functionality.

Fully grounded trust for this would require a formal model of how hardware populates ACPI tables and formal verification of ACPI
parsing code on general-purpose desktop and server machines, or a formalized and verified
parsing of flattened device trees (plus trust that a system was booted with a correct FDT) for (semi-)embedded systems like single-board
ARM and RISC-V machines. Either route would also require detailed treatment of memory-mapped IO triggering
interrupts on other CPUs. This is far beyond any formal model of computer hardware that exists today,
and far out of scope for this paper.


\citet{syeda2020formal,syeda2018program} are the only existing work to address formal verification of TLB management.
They extend the work of \citet{kolanski08ssv,kolanski09tphols,kolanski09tphols}, and therefore inherit the limitations of that work discussed
elsewhere in this paper. Aside from that, their logic primarily tracks a set of mapped addresses and a set of
cached addresses, and generally preserve a global invariant (in a global Hoare logic, not a separation logic)
that the cached addresses are a subset of the mapped addresses. When this invariant is violated, the logic provides only
a Hoare-style backwards assignment type rule with unconstrained assertion $P$, rather than providing structure in the logic
for reasoning about how to restore the invariant. Most technical results in the paper focus on proving
transparency lemmas, that code that \emph{does not} modify page tables (kernel code outside the VMM, user code)
is unaffected by its existence. The one piece of kernel code verified is a sequence of 4 pseudo-instructions for changing address spaces
which include \emph{only} the installation of a new page table root and flushing of the old address space from the TLB.

Adapting Syeda and Klein's global reasoning principles to a separation logic is non-trivial, even though their approach
does capture some intuition about TLB reasoning. And as noted above, in the absence of support for significant additional
hardware functionality in the hardware model, this would be substantial work for only very limited gains in confidence compared
to trusting single-core TLB managment.
Thus we leave TLB management to our future work plans, where we believe it is best addressed in tandem with substantially
richer hardware models than any currently existing.
