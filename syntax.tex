\section{Machine State, Instructions, Naming Registers and Memory Translation}
\label{sec:syntax}
To develop our core logical ideas and explain their intepretation, we need only a handful of instructions, and a machine model corresponding to execution of x86-64 assembly instructions with virtual memory enabled on the CPU.

\subsection{Registers and Memory}
Programs we demonstrate in this paper requires accessing two types of computer resource: registers and memory. A register identifier, $\reg$, is chosen from a fixed finite set of register identifiers,$\regset$. We use these identifiers to access the register values, $\regval \in \regvaltype$. Unlike registers, we do not abstract the memory indices as a special type but instead, for the sake of clarity and ease of representation, we show differently masked machine words, $\loc \in \Loc$, with the subscripts showing the length of a 64-bit machine word after masking, e.g. $\kw{w}_{12}$ is a 12-bit resource which can be obtained after masking 52-bit of a 64-bit word.
This simple syntax in \ref{fig:syntax} includes a simple syntax for values because our language is purely \textit{imperative}, i.e. an instruction does not return a value. Intentionally, we restrict any stream of instruction, $\instrs$, to eventually reduce to $\iskip$ instruction which is injected into unit. Our syntax capture the no-op ``$\iskip$'' and the sequencing construct ``$\iseq{\instr}{\instrs}$'' in their standard forms.

\todo[inline]{Ismail: this paper is not about the binding of the machine model to Iris. Low-level details like ``injected into unit'' are not really important unless someone asks.}
