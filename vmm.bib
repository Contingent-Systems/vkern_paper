                for sequential Java. Foremost, this includes full functional
                verification against contracts written in the Java Modeling
                Language. But the approach is general enough to provide a basis
                for other methods and purposes: (i) complementary validation
                techniques to formal verification such as testing and debugging,
                (ii) methods that reduce the complexity of verification such as
                modularization and abstract interpretation, (iii) analyses of
                non-functional properties such as information flow security, and
                (iv) sound program transformation and code generation. We show
                that deductive technology that has been developed for full
                functional verification can be used as a basis and framework for
                other purposes than pure functional verification. We use the
                current release of the \KeY\ system as an example to explain and
                prove this claim.},
